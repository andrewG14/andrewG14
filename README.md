### Hi there, my name is Andrew and I'm a Computational Biologist from the San Francisco Bay Area. I currently live in Boston, Massachusetts. My educational background is a M.S. in Bioinformatics (Boston University) and a B.S. in Biomolecular Engineering (University of California, Santa Cruz). My main coding strengths are Python and R. This repository contains a selection of code I've written over the years to highlight some of my skills.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning SQL and the Python's TensorFlow library.
